This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:" are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - "projects/", e.g. "projects/tokyo-rain-123" - "folders/", e.g. "folders/1234" - "organizations/", e.g. "organizations/1234" The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset.

However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: "E3" value: "E4" inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: "E1"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1->{F1, F2}; F1->{P1}; F2->{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: "under:organizations/O1"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: "under:projects/P3"} {denied_values: "under:folders/F2"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`.

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

/// Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a google.cloud.asset.v1.Asset in the JSON format; for BigQuery table destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset proto as columns. This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API , which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes within 5 minutes.

To learn more about the IAM policy structure, see [IAM policy doc](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies#structure).

Note that if callers don't have `iam.roles.get` access to a role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results. * `policy.role.permissions:upd*` to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing "upd" as a prefix of any word in the role permission. Note that if callers don't have `iam.roles.get` access to a role's included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results. * `resource:organizations/123456` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on "organizations/123456". * `resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project named "myproject". * `Important` to find IAM policy bindings that contain "Important" as a word in any of the searchable fields (except for the included permissions). * `resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on resources "instance1" or "instance2" and also specify user "amy".
