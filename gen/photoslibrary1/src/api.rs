If an album `id` is specified, the call adds the media item to the album too. Each album can contain up to 20,000 media items. By default, the media item will be added to the end of the library or album. If an album `id` and position are both defined, the media item is added to the album at the specified position. If the call contains multiple media items, they're added at the specified position. If you are creating a media item in a shared album where you are not the owner, you are not allowed to position the media item. Doing so will result in a `BAD REQUEST` error.
